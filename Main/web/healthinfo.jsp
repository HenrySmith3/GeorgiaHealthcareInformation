                    One should receive a blood pressure test every two years if at a normal blood pressure and more often if in an abnormal range. Cholesterol tests should be received regularly starting at age 35 and before that if at an increased risk for heart disease. Colorectal cancer screening should be received starting at age 50 through 75. Screening for diabetes should begin based on family history, blood pressure, and other identifiable risk factors. Sexual health test (HIV, syphilis) should be conducted if you are at an increased risk. Check with your doctor for other tests if a smoker. See a doctor if you are unsure about any of these screening recommendations.

                    Obtaining early health care is an important part of a healthy pregnancy and ensuring the health of an unborn baby. Before a woman even begins planning to become pregnant, she must give herself at least three months as a recommendation to prepare herself for having. This part of prenatal health care is called preconception health, and it is vital. During the preconception health period, a woman should take a constant amount of folic acid (about 0.4 to 0.8 mg), eat healthy, and exercise. It is important to see a doctor as soon as you may suspect that you may be pregnant. The earlier and more frequently you see your doctor the higher the chance to correct any complications that may occur. For the 4th to 28th weeks, one should see their doctor about once a month. For the 28th to 36th weeks, one should see their doctor twice a month. For the final weeks 36th to birth, a woman should see her doctor weekly to watch the progress of her unborn baby.
